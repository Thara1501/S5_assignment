Purpose: The objective of this problem is to learn Pytorch, modularization and use NN based approach to 
recognize handwritten digits

For this purpose, we have 3 python files.

- Plotting accuracy and loss graphs
- Training the model code

utils.py
- Contains, defining the neural network structure for this experiment

model.py
- Defining the batch size 
- Computing backropagation
- Computing loss/accuracy
- Plotting the accuracy and loss
